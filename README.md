Josh Carlson's knitting patterns

Most of my other projects are managed through Git, so why not knitting? In my experience, developing, testing, and distributing new knitting patterns has certain similarities to software development. Only, a *lot* slower.

# Purpose

I've written a handful of patterns in the past. You know what happened to the original files? Yeah, me either!
Rather than stuff these into some Word doc somewhere and lose track of them, I want to get my patterns into a repository, both for my own safekeeping and for easier sharing and collaboration.

# Using These Patterns

You can read [the license](./LICENSE) for the full details, but basically, take these patterns and use them! Make something out of them. Even sell the things you make, I really don't mind!

# Long Term Vision

I love Elizabeth Zimmerman's "recipe" patterns. I don't actually follow patterns much myself, as my gauge is very different from apparently most pattern writers out there. Maybe these patterns will turn into an actual piece of software for generating modified patterns based on an input gauge, who knows?
