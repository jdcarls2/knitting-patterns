# Overview

This pattern makes a hat that should sort of look like a football helmet. Optional face guards.

## The short version

1. Start at the top of the hat.
2. Knit a flat top for a few rows (that's 8 increases every other row, on average)
3. Switch to a more rounded top for a few more (6 increases every other row)
4. Knit straight for an inch or so
5. Bind off the "brim"
6. Continue knitting sides and back
7. Do some short rows to shape the ear protectors
8. Throw in some decreases to get the curve just right.

## Face guards

I say optional, but you really *need* these to get the football look.
1. Just make a really long i-cord.
2. Thread some coated solid-core coper wire into the i-cord. (Nothing too thick or rigid, just enough to hold a shape.)
3. Cut into lengths.
4. Fold the end of the wire over or by some means dull the cut end.
5. Sew the ends onto the helmet.

## Logos

If you're into intarsia, by all means. I'm not, so I just darn a logo over the top of my stitches after the fact. Just hope your recipient picked a team with a really simple logo!
